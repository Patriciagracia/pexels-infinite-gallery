# Pexels Infinite Gallery

A responsive React application built with the Pexels API. It features infinite scroll, a favourite system with local persistence, and a responsive design. I also took the liberty of adding a search input and a favourites pop-up gallery.

By default, the app loads a selection of curated photos provided by Pexels. Users can also search for specific images by keyword. All images are displayed in an infinitely scrollable gallery. Each image can be saved as a favourite, and removed again if the user changes their mind.

## Installation

This project was created using the latest version of **Vite** and **React 19**, and developed with **Node.js 24.4.0**.

To run the project locally:

**1. Install dependencies**

```
npm install
```

**2. Start the development server**

```
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure & Planning

Task planning was done in Trello, where I broke down the work into key steps: starting with the API integration, building the gallery that displays the images, then implementing infinite scroll, and finally building the favourites system. I also considered several extra features to improve usability, including an image search bar and a dedicated pop-up window to display the user's favourites.
